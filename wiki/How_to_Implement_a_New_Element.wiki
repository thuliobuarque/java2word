=How to Implement a New Element/Component=

= Introduction =

This document gives you the guidelines how to implement a new element/component for the Java2Word project.

_For this java2word library, "Bold" is not an Element - it is Style. Consider this only a simple demonstration how to implement something in this framework.

_

= Details =

Imagine you want to use one component and this component does not exist yet. A good example could be the "Lists", which hasn't been done yet (27-Mar-2011). But for this exercise we will use "Bold". 

Lets define steps how to implement this "Bold"(or any other) component.

==If you are not a  "committer" in this project or submit the code by attaching the changed classes to the issue==


==Set up your Development Environment==

  * Check out those projects *j2w-ejb* and optionally *j2w-webtest*
  * In the j2w-ejb directory, run: "mvn clean install"
  
This is it! Simple like that!

If you use eclipse, run "mvn eclipse:eclipse" in order to import the project to it.
  
Optionally, after a successful build, you can take a look at your .m2 folder and you should be able to see the generated jar in : ~/.m2/repository/java2word/j2w-ejb/1.0/j2w-ejb-1.0.jar 

  
  * Now your can run the *deploy* task on this file
  * Start your JBoss and access the url: http://localhost:8080/j2w
  * You should see one green web page with a big text area in the middle. In this textarea.


== Code development ==

Now you will see that there is no mystery behind this. 

  * Create your class called *Bold2004.java* implementing the interface *IElement.java* (Assume we will use Microsoft Word 2004).
  * Also create a test class called *Bold2004Test.java*
  * Preferable, first write your test in the class 
  * Write the code of the method is *getContent()*
  
I assume you don't know what to write in your *getContent()* right? Now it is time to do the *reverse engineering* and figure out how to implement the code to generate *bold* block.
 
  * Open your Microsoft Word 2004 (or greater then)
  * Type some text, select part of the text and make it *bold*. I typed: <br>
Leonardo Correa and made Correa bold. Eg.: Leonardo *Correa*
  * Save it as "Word 2003 XML Document"
  * Open using any text editor

At this point you can see something like:

{{{
... more stuff...

	<w:p wsp:rsidR="00D711DA" wsp:rsidRDefault="00FE5527">
		<w:r>
			<w:t>Leonardo </w:t>
		</w:r>
			<w:r wsp:rsidRPr="00FE5527">
			<w:rPr>
				<w:b/>
			</w:rPr>
				<w:t>Correa</w:t>
			</w:r>
	</w:p>

... more stuff...
}}}

Now we know how to implement *bold* component!!!

  * I would create a constructor to receive the text to be made bold.
{{{
   Class Bold2004(String text){
     this.newBoldText = text;
   } 
}}}

  * After, I would the variable with the place holder. 
{{{
String BOLD_TEMPLATE = 
	"<w:r wsp:rsidRPr=\"00FE5527\">"
	+"	<w:rPr> "                
	+"		<w:b/> "
	+"	</w:rPr> "
	+"	<w:t>{I_am_a_place_holder}</w:t> "
	"</w:r>";
}}}

  * Time to replace the place holder and return the *getContent()*; 
{{{

  public String getContent() {
     return BOLD_TEMPLATE.replace("{I_am_a_place_holder}", this.newBoldText);   
  }

}}}

  * And I would utilize like that:

{{{
   IDocument myDoc = new Document2004();
   myDoc.getBody().addEle( new Paragraph2004("Leonardo" + new Bold2004("Correa")) );
}}}

  Not finished yet, you need to know if your new element really works in a real Microsoft Word document.

  * In your unit test, create a Document2004
  * Add one paragraph with some bold text. Eg.: 

{{{
   IDocument myDoc = new Document2004();
   myDoc.getBody().addEle( new Paragraph2004("Leonardo" + new Bold2004("Correa")) );
}}}

  * Print out (just for a while) the *myDoc.getContent()*, copy the result to your clip board.


  * Go to: http://localhost:8080/j2w (which is part of your development environment) and paste in the textarea.
 
  * Click in the button to download, save the *whatever.doc* anywhere in your local machine.

  * Open the document with Microsoft Word 2003+ and see your bold text!


_Remember to run the *"Code Metrics"* task in Ant and see the *Cobertura* report. Your code should have at least 90% test coverage. Please refer to *"Code quality*, guidelines" Section in the main page of this project_

This was just a demonstration how to create a new element in this API. I haven't implemented this yet.
