#This page shows how to use the elements of the API.

= Introduction =

This document will describe all elements of the *Java2Word API* and show how to use them. For each element, there are two sections "Description" and "Style - Superstylin".

"Description" is a short description of the element and has some sample code to illustrate the usage of the element.

The other section "Style - Superstylin" presents all possible styles applied to the elements with some examples as well.

We will start from the most popular/simple to the most complex.

The term "*SuperStylin*" means simply "Style". *SuperStylin* is the name I gave to the new Styling Framework. It is inspired on *Groove Armada - Superstylin'*

SuperStylin framework is still in development...

_ Remember that W2000 has been removed from the API. We will use only W2004 elements._


----
= Document =
== Description ==
This is the main class of the API. Use this class to add other elements to the document.
When you create an instance of Document. 

{{{
IDocument myDoc = new Document2004();
myDoc.getBody().addEle(new Paragraph("Hi! I am a paragraph"));
}}}

The example above shows how to add one Paragraph to the body.

Body contains another two classes: Header, Footer.

----
= Heading = 

== Description ==
Heading is the element utilized for creating hierarchy sections of the document. It is used to generate the document index. There are three levels of Headings: Heading1, Heading2 and Heading3.

See how to create a Heading1:
{{{
Heading1 h1 = new Heading1("Heading 111");
}}}  

How to add it to the body of the Document:
{{{
myDoc.getBody().addEle(h1);
}}}

== Superstylin ==

-*for instance, ONLY Heading1 allows SuperStylin._

  * Align (options: CENTER, LEFT(default), RIGHT, JUSTIFIED.

Element that will receive the style:
{{{
Heading1 h1 = new Heading1("Heading 111");
}}}

Create the new heading style object and configure it.
{{{
HeadingStyle headingStyle = new HeadingStyle(); 
headingStyle.setAlign(HeadingStyle.Align.CENTER);
}}}

Apply the style to the element:
{{{
h1.setStyle(headingStyle); 
}}}

  * Bold (boolean)

{{{
headingStyle.setItalic(true);
}}}

  * Italic (boolean)

{{{
headingStyle.setBold(true);
}}}
