#This page shows how to use the elements of the API.

= Introduction =

This document will describe all elements of the *Java2Word API* and show how to use them. For each element, there are two sections "Description" and "Style - Superstylin".

"Description" is a short description of the element and has some sample code to illustrate the usage of the element.

The other section "Style - Superstylin" presents all possible styles applied to the elements with some examples as well.

We will start from the most popular/simple to the most complex.

_ Remember that W2000 has been removed from the API. We will use only W2004 elements._
