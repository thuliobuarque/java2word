= Introduction =

This document gives you the guidelines how to implement a new component for the Java2Word project.


= Details =

Imagine you want to use one component and this component does not exist yet. O good example could be the "Bold" element which hasn't been done yet (08-Aug-2010).

Lets define steps how to implement this "Bold"(or any other) component.

==You should be added as a "committer" in this project==

  * just contact me

==Set up your Development Environment==

  * Check out those projects: j2w-app, j2w-ear, j2w-ejb, j2w-war
  * In the j2w-app directory, run: mvn eclipse:eclipse 
  * Optionally, at this moment you can run "mvn clean install" and you should have an successful build. Take a look at your .m2 folder and you should be able to see the generated jar in : ~/.m2/repository/java2word/j2w-ejb/1.0/j2w-ejb-1.0.jar 
  * Import those projects to your Eclipse (or whatever other IDE) 
  * In the project *j2w-app*, copy and paste the file *build.properties.example*; rename to *build.properties*
  * Open your new *build.properties* and change your ant variable *jboss.dir*.
  * Add this new file to the *ignore list* in your SVN (I use subclipse). 
  * Now your can run the *deploy* task on this file
  * Start your JBoss and access the url: http://localhost:8080/j2w
  * You should see one green web page with a big text area in the middle. In this textarea.
